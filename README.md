# ![nf-core/tower-action](img/nfcore-toweraction_logo.png)

**A GitHub Action to launch a workflow using [Nextflow Tower](https://tower.nf) - <https://tower.nf>.**

This action uses the [Nextflow Tower CLI](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli/).

# This repository has moved to [seqeralabs/action-tower-launch](https://github.com/seqeralabs/action-tower-launch)

The action will now be maintained by [@SeqeraLabs](https://github.com/seqeralabs). With :heart: from @nf-core :blush:

This nf-core repository will be kept online for the forseeable future so that we don't break any repositories using it.
All future development will continue on the Seqera Labs repo.
